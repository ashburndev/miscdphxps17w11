Java Post Connection Using Try with Resources

I want to implement the code for handling POST requests using try with resources.
Following is my code:

public static String sendPostRequestDummy(String url, String queryString) {
    log.info("Sending 'POST' request to URL : " + url);
    log.info("Data : " + queryString);
    BufferedReader in = null;
    HttpURLConnection con = null;
    StringBuilder response = new StringBuilder();
    try{
        URL obj = new URL(url);
        con = (HttpURLConnection) obj.openConnection();
        // add request header
        con.setRequestMethod("POST");
        con.setRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0");
        con.setRequestProperty("Accept-Language", "en-US,en;q=0.5");
        con.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/json");
        // Send post request
        con.setDoOutput(true);
        DataOutputStream wr = new DataOutputStream(con.getOutputStream());
        wr.writeBytes(queryString);
        wr.flush();
        wr.close();
        int responseCode = con.getResponseCode();
        log.info("Response Code : " + responseCode);
        if (responseCode >= 400)
            in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(con.getErrorStream()));
        else 
            in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(con.getInputStream()));

        String inputLine;

        while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {
            response.append(inputLine);
        }
    }catch(Exception e){
        log.error(e.getMessage(), e);
        log.error("Error during posting request");
    }
    finally{
        closeConnectionNoException(in,con);
    }
    return response.toString();
}

I have the following concerns for the code:

    How to introduce conditional statements in try with resources for the above scenario?
    Is there a way to pass on the connection in try with resources? (It can be done using nested try-catch blocks since URL and HTTPConnection is not AutoCloseable, which itself is not a compliant solution)
    Is using try with resources for the above problem is a better approach?

    javaexceptiontry-catchtry-with-resources

Try this.

HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) obj.openConnection();
try (AutoCloseable conc = () -> con.disconnect()) {
    // add request headers
    try (DataOutputStream wr = new DataOutputStream(con.getOutputStream())) {
        wr.writeBytes(queryString);
    }
    int responseCode = con.getResponseCode();
    try (InputStream ins = responseCode >= 400 ? con.getErrorStream() : con.getInputStream();
        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(ins))) {
        // receive response
    }
}

() -> con.disconnect() is a lambda expression which execute con.disconnect() at finally stage of the try statement.

HttpURLConnection does not implement the AutoCloseable interface in Java 8 or later versions. Since HttpURLConnection does not implement AutoCloseable, you cannot use it directly in a try-with-resources block. However, you can create a wrapper class that implements AutoCloseable and encapsulates the HttpURLConnection object, and then use the wrapper class in a try-with-resources block.

1: You can use conditional statements inside try with resources statement also. Unfortunately you have to define new variable for this block and cannot use a predefined variable. ( variable in in your code)

try (BufferedReader in = (responseCode >= 400 ? new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(con.getErrorStream())) : new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(con.getInputStream())))) {
   // your code for getting string data
}

2: I'm not sure HttpUrlConnection is AutoCloseable, So it might be a good idea to call the disconnect() yourself. I'm open to any suggestion on this one.

3: try with resources will definitely help you in managing the resources. But if you're confident that you're releasing the resources properly after use, then your code is fine.
