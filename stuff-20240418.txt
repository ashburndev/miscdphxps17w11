keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore baeldung.jks -destkeystore baeldung.p12 -deststoretype pkcs12

Then we’ll copy the file named “baeldung.p12,” generated in the previous step, into the “src/main/resources/keystore” directory.

Now we’ll configure the SSL related properties:
  # The format used for the keystore. It could be set to JKS in case it is a JKS file
  server.ssl.key-store-type=PKCS12
  # The path to the keystore containing the certificate
  server.ssl.key-store=classpath:keystore/baeldung.p12
  # The password used to generate the certificate
  server.ssl.key-store-password=password
  # The alias mapped to the certificate
  server.ssl.key-alias=baeldung
Since we’re using a Spring Security enabled application, let’s configure it to accept only HTTPS requests:
  server.ssl.enabled=true
